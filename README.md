# non-custodial-escrow

This is a non-custodial escrow program that lives on the Solana Blockchain. With the help of this account, anyone can exchange their assets for new ones without having to trust a third party.

This function is a simple 3-function non-custodial escrow that operates on-chain. Users will be able to:
- create a new escrow linked to the assets they wish to exchange for a new one.
- accept the escrow and exchange the current assets for a new one.
- if they don't wish to exchange their assets for new ones, they can cancel the escrow
